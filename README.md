Credit Card Validation Exercise
===============================

In this project you will find the user interface for a simple credit card details input. It is, however, missing the logic to validate. Use the functions in CardType and ValidationUtils to determine if all of the fields have valid inputs.

Advanced: Use the FocusWatcherObservable to make it so the focused field does not get highlighted as erroneus.
